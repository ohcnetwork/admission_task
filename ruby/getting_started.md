## Getting started

1. Install Ruby: You need to have ruby installed in your computer for this problem.

   You may already have Ruby installed on your computer. You can check inside a terminal emulator by typing:

   ```
   ruby -v
   ```

   This should output some information on the installed Ruby version.
   You can also install ruby by following these instructions: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

2. You are expected to write the code in `task.rb` file.

3. Once you are done with the changes you should be able to execute the task app by running the following command from the terminal.

   **On Windows:**

   ```
   .\task.bat
   ```

   **On \*nix:**

   ```
   ./task.sh
   ```
