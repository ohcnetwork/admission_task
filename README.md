# Global Digital Corps - Software Engineering Test Problem | Priority list

[https://fullstack.gdc.network](https://fullstack.gdc.network)

This repo contains the starting templates for all supported languages in the challenge.

_**Please note that this repository is not meant for collaboration.** While we appreciate issues and pull requests, we cannot guarantee any response &mdash; we may close issues and PRs without explanation._

Kindly desist from sharing your solution privately or publicly. This is because the programming task is not complex for those who've written non-trivial amount of code before. But for beginners, solving this can be quite instructive - frustrating at times, but rewarding in the end.

But if you share your solution with them - through a GitHub repo, or by circulating in your private networks, you're only robbing them of a rewarding experience that would have helped them grow as programmers.

It is trivial to detect copy-cat code submissions and students who submit plagiarized code will be unable to find a place among the limited seats in the course. It is just that it'll take us a few more moments to read through the code and tag it. A lose-lose proposition for all concerned.

---

That said, we hope you find the challenge interesting. We've found more students who've worked through the problem diligently and have written in about the magic of programming than what any of us hoped to, when we first announced the course.

The seats in this particular course are limited - but that shouldn't deter you - there is no limit to how much you can grow if you continue to enjoy programming and work at it.

We wish you best of luck and look forward to reading your code submissions!

# Base Project Setup with Starter Packs

This repository provides pre-built starter packs for various programming languages, helping you quickly set up a base project. Each starter pack comes with a pre-configured environment, including the necessary files and documentation to get you started.

## Available Starter Packs

The following starter packs are available:

- **C**: `fellowship-c.zip`
- **C++**: `fellowship-cpp.zip`
- **JavaScript**: `fellowship-javascript.zip`
- **Ruby**: `fellowship-ruby.zip`
- **Python**: `fellowship-python.zip`
- **Java**: `fellowship-java.zip`

## How to Use a Starter Pack

### Step 1: Select the Appropriate Zip File

Choose the zip file that corresponds to the programming language you wish to use:

- If you are working in **C**, download `fellowship-c.zip`.
- If you are working in **C++**, download `fellowship-cpp.zip`.
- If you are working in **JavaScript**, download `fellowship-javascript.zip`.
- If you are working in **Ruby**, download `fellowship-ruby.zip`.
- If you are working in **Python**, download `fellowship-python.zip`.
- If you are working in **Java**, download `fellowship-java.zip`.

### Step 2: Unzip the Starter Pack

Extract the contents of the selected zip file into your project directory. For example, if you are using the JavaScript starter pack, run:

```bash
unzip fellowship-javascript.zip -d your-project-directory
```

### Step 3: Follow the Included README Instructions

Each starter pack includes a `README.md` file with language-specific instructions. Once you have unzipped the starter pack, open the `README.md` file in your project directory and follow the instructions to get your project up and running.

For example:

- **C Starter Pack**: Instructions on compiling and running C programs.
- **JavaScript Starter Pack**: Instructions on setting up and running a Node.js environment.
- **Python Starter Pack**: Instructions on setting up a Python environment and running scripts.

### Step 4: Build Your Task Manager

Use the starter pack as a base to build your task manager. You can add the required features as per the requirements and test your implementation using the Makefile in your starter pack.
